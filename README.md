# ExtractDat3

Python 3 version of **John Hartman's** Python 2.7 Extractdat 

(see https://github.com/jhh67/extractdat). 

The whole documentation and associated paper is within their repository.

Here, the magic methods of the different classes and the writing methods have been changed to match Python 3.

Also, the CLI and Drag and Drop has been replaced by the python built-in library Tkinter to create a GUI and pick files. The program behaves the same in terms of processing and saving files.

Another addition was the option of loading bars by using the amazing `tqdm` package. It is not necessary to have it, but if installed, will be used to create loading bars for each .dat files and scans. 

To use this program now, you just have to either double-click on it to launch it or execute the script from the terminal.

If there is any comments, feedback or feature requests I would be very happy to answer them!

I also plan to translate RecoverDat.py in a similar manner when I will have time.
